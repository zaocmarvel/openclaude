/**
 * Deterministic JSON serialization.
 *
 * WHY: OpenAI / Kimi / DeepSeek / Codex all use **implicit prefix caching**
 * — the server hashes the request prefix and reuses cached reasoning if
 * the bytes match exactly. Even a trivial key-order difference between
 * two otherwise-identical requests invalidates the hash and forces a
 * full re-parse.
 *
 * This is also a pre-requisite for Anthropic / Bedrock / Vertex
 * `cache_control` breakpoints: ephemeral cache entries match on exact
 * content, so a re-ordered object literal busts the breakpoint.
 *
 * `JSON.stringify` is nondeterministic across engines and across
 * successive iterations when objects carry keys added at different
 * times (V8 preserves insertion order, which is the common failure
 * mode when building a body from spread-merged configs).
 *
 * This helper recursively sorts object keys. Arrays preserve order
 * (element order IS semantically significant in message/content arrays).
 *
 * Complements `sortKeysDeep` in src/services/remoteManagedSettings and
 * src/services/policyLimits. Those two are INTENTIONALLY separate:
 *   - remoteManagedSettings: matches Python `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`
 *     byte-for-byte to validate server-computed checksums. Must NOT
 *     drop undefined (Python preserves null).
 *   - policyLimits: uses `localeCompare` (keeps legacy behavior; locale-
 *     sensitive but stable for a given runtime).
 *   - this module (stableStringify): byte-identity for API body caching.
 *     Drops undefined to match `JSON.stringify` — the openaiShim/codexShim
 *     body is always downstream of `JSON.stringify` semantics.
 * Do not consolidate without auditing the 3 callers — each has a
 * different server-compat contract.

/**
 * Returns a byte-stable JSON string representation.
 * - Object keys are emitted in lexicographic order at every depth.
 * - Array element order is preserved.
 * - Undefined values are dropped (matching `JSON.stringify`).
 * - Indentation matches the `space` argument (0 by default → compact).
 *
 * Native `JSON.stringify` pre-processing is preserved before sorting:
 *   - `toJSON(key)` is invoked on objects that define it (own or
 *     inherited — covers `Date`, `URL`, and any user class). The `key`
 *     argument is the property name for nested object values, the array
 *     index as a string for array elements, and `''` for the top-level
 *     call, matching native semantics.
 *   - Boxed primitive wrappers (`new Number(...)`, `new String(...)`,
 *     `new Boolean(...)`) are unboxed to their primitive form.
 * Both happen BEFORE the array/object branches dispatch, so the value
 * actually walked is the post-conversion form. If `toJSON` returns
 * `undefined`, the value is dropped from its parent (matching native
 * `JSON.stringify`).
 *
 * Single-pass: `deepSort` walks the (possibly converted) value tree
 * once, building a sorted clone. A `WeakSet` of ancestors tracks the
 * current path through the object graph so that circular references
 * throw `TypeError` (same contract as native `JSON.stringify`). The
 * cycle check runs on the post-`toJSON` value, so a `toJSON` impl that
 * returns an ancestor still throws. Ancestors are always removed in a
 * `finally` block when unwinding out of each object branch (even on
 * exception), so DAG inputs — where the same object is reachable via
 * multiple keys — are handled correctly and do not throw.
